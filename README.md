### Notes / Credits
* App format copied from [heart-of-frogg](https://github.com/bfroggio/heart-of-frogg/)
* While using the app you must connect your watch to your phone via bluetooth, and your phone to the same wifi as your computer
* I'm working on getting fitbit app to send OSC data directly to vrchat without the server hosted on PC, if I get that working i'll push it here
